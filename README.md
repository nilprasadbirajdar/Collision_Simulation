# Collision_Simulation


## Project Overview

This educational project simulates collisions among debris particles in Saturn's ring using C++, QT, and OpenGL. The simulation provides a visual representation of the interactions between debris particles, allowing users to explore and understand the dynamics of collisions in a microgravity environment.

## Features

- simulation of debris collisions.
- Visualization of particle movement and collision dynamics.
- User-friendly QT interface for easy interaction.

## Dependencies

- C++ compiler compatible with C++11 or later.
- QT framework (version 6.6.1 or later).
- OpenGL libraries.

## Getting Started

**Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nilprasadbirajdar/Collision_Simulator.git
   cd Collision_Simulator
